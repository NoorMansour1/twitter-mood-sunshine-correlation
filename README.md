# MBD-twitter-project
 This repository hosts the code used for the final project of the Managing Big Data project of group 20 at the University of Twente.
 
The weather can have an impact on people's mood. Social media platforms like Twitter are a big source of data when it comes to the sentiment of the population. This research aims to identify what the influence of time and solar radiation is on the sentiment of Dutch tweets. Sentiment analysis was performed on a dataset of Dutch tweets that are grouped per hour of the day. These sentiment scores were compared to the solar radiation at that specific time. With regards to time it was found that sentiment of Dutch tweets is higher in the evening compared to daytime. Furthermore, it was found that solar radiation has a small, but significant positive correlation with sentiment of Dutch tweets.
